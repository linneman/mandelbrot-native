# Parallel Rendering of the Mandelbrot Set

This is an implementation of the famous
[Mandelbrot set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)  renderer which is
implemented  in ANSI-C  incorporating the  pthread  and the  SDL libraries.  The
object  is to  achieve the  maximum possible  performance on  modern multi  core
CPU's. The  program runs on Unixiod  computing platforms such as  Linux, BSD and
Mac OS X.


## Build Dependencies

Beside essential build packages, the  programs requires a development version of
the  libsdl2  library to  be  installed  (package libsd2-dev  on  debian/Ubuntu,
libSDL2-devel on OpenSuSE, SDL on the  Mac). In exmple use the following command
to install this library via Homebrew on the Macintosh platform:

    brew install SDL


## Download and Build

Download and compile the application via the following shell commands:

    git clone git://github/linneman/mandelbrot-native.git
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install


## Usage

The program renders the mandelbrot set by  default with 50 threads and a maximum
iteration depth  of 1000 steps  within an graphical  window. Start the program
by entering

    parmandel

within a terminal. Drag with the left mouse key into an area to zoom in. Use the
left mouse botton  or a two finger tap  on the mac to zoom out  to the previosly
selected area.
